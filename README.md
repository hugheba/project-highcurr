## Plugins
    
The chat consists of event-hooked Javascript plugins that are loaded, compiled and cached in the Java.

To create a plugin, create a javascript file in the `:highcurr-plugins/src/chat` folder.

Add a function to your plugin named with the event hook it should be called for: i.e. onBeforePublishClient.

The function should accept and return the same object, 
an [EventClass](highcurr-ws/src/main/kotlin/highcurr/highcurrws/vertx/verticle/wsserver/EventClass.kt)

    {"body": ""}

You can reload plugins without restarting the server with the following URL:
